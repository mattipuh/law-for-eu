description: >
  Dedicated vendor agreement review for procurement — applies the purchasing-side
  playbook, runs a DORA Art. 30 ICT third-party compliance check for financial
  entities, and flags concentration risk if the vendor already appears in your ICT
  register. Most relevant for financial institutions procuring technology or services.
  Use when the user says "review this vendor agreement", "check this MSA from a
  supplier", "DORA compliance check on this contract", or attaches an inbound
  vendor agreement for procurement review.

1. Load `~/.claude/plugins/config/eu-legal/CLAUDE.md`. If missing or has `[PLACEHOLDER]`, stop: "Run `/eu-legal:cold-start-interview` first."
2. Load `~/.claude/plugins/config/eu-legal/commercial.md`. If missing or has `[PLACEHOLDER]`, stop: "Run `/eu-legal:commercial-cold-start` first."
3. Get the agreement (file path, Drive link, or pasted text). If none, ask.
4. Run the workflow below.

## Purpose

Review an inbound vendor agreement against the purchasing-side playbook. For financial entities procuring ICT services, perform a full DORA Art. 30 minimum contract clause check. Flag concentration risk if the vendor is already in the ICT register.

**This is a draft for attorney review and does not constitute legal advice.**

## Step 1: Orient

Read the whole agreement once, fast. Answer:

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Agreement type | MSA / SaaS subscription / Professional services / Licence / Other |
| Vendor / counterparty | Name |
| Is this an ICT service? | Yes (network, hardware, software, data, cloud, managed service) / No |
| Dollar / EUR value | Annual / total contract value if stated |
| Term | Length, renewal mechanics |
| DPA status | Attached / referenced by URL / missing |
| Order form | Separate doc or integrated |
| Concentration risk | Is this vendor already in `commercial.md` critical_ict_providers list? |

**EUR value handling:** If the MSA does not state a value (price is in an Order Form not in hand), stop and ask:
> "The MSA itself doesn't state a contract value. The Order Form carries the price. Your escalation threshold is EUR [from commercial.md]. Before routing, I need the ACV. Options: (1) paste the Order Form value, (2) tell me above or below EUR [threshold] and I'll route accordingly, (3) route conservatively to the higher approver."

**DPA by reference:** If the DPA is incorporated by URL, note: "DPA referenced at [URL] but not reviewed. Route to `/eu-legal:dpa-review` (if installed) before signing. `[DPA unread — verify]`"

**Concentration risk flag:** If the vendor name appears in `commercial.md` `critical_ict_providers`, flag:
> "Concentration risk: [Vendor] is already listed as a critical ICT third-party provider in your ICT register. This additional agreement increases concentration in this provider. Consider whether this is acceptable under your DORA ICT risk management framework."

---

## Step 2: Deal-breaker check

Check `commercial.md` purchasing-side deal-breaker first. If present, flag at the top and stop detailed review until resolved.

---

## Step 3: DORA Art. 30 ICT third-party compliance check

**Gate:** Run this step only if:
- Entity type in `CLAUDE.md` is a financial entity (`credit_institution`, `payment_institution`, `e_money_institution`, `investment_firm`, `aifm`, `ucits`, `insurance`, `reinsurance`)
- AND the vendor provides ICT services (as determined in Step 1)

**If `VELVOITE_API_KEY` is set:**

Call `mcp__velvoite__get_canonical_obligations` with:
- `regulation`: `dora`
- `actor_role`: `financial_entity`

From the obligations returned, extract the Art. 30 minimum contract clause requirements. For each requirement, check whether it is present and adequate in the draft agreement.

**If `VELVOITE_API_KEY` is not set:**

Use the static DORA Art. 30 checklist below. Each clause marked MISSING or INSUFFICIENT is 🔴 RED.

| Art. 30 Minimum Clause | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Description of all services and functions** — clear description of all ICT services and functions to be provided by the ICT third-party service provider, including indication of whether sub-contracting of an ICT service supporting a critical or important function is permitted (Art. 30(2)(a)) | | |
| **Locations** — locations where ICT services are to be provided and where data is to be processed, including sub-locations; ICT third-party service provider must notify the financial entity if it intends to change such locations (Art. 30(2)(b)) | | |
| **Data provisions** — provisions on availability, authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality in relation to the protection of data, including personal data (Art. 30(2)(c)) | | |
| **Access and recovery** — provisions ensuring access, recovery, and return in an easily accessible format of personal and non-personal data processed by the financial entity in the case of insolvency, resolution, or discontinuation of business operations of the ICT third-party service provider (Art. 30(2)(d)) | | |
| **Service levels** — service level descriptions, including updates and revisions thereof, with precise quantitative and qualitative performance targets, allowing effective monitoring by the financial entity so that corrective actions can be undertaken without undue delay (Art. 30(2)(e)) | | |
| **Information security** — relevant provisions on ICT security, including minimum information security standards (Art. 30(2)(f)) | | |
| **Sub-contracting** — provisions on the conditions for the sub-contracting of ICT services supporting critical or important functions, including the right to object to sub-contracting (Art. 30(2)(g)) | | |
| **Cooperation with authorities** — full cooperation of the ICT third-party service provider with competent authorities and resolution authorities of the financial entity (Art. 30(2)(h)) | | |
| **Termination rights** — termination rights of the financial entity, including a reasonable notice period for the termination of the ICT contracts (Art. 30(2)(i)) | | |
| **Exit plan** — participation and full support of the ICT third-party service provider to the financial entity's ICT exit plan, including the transfer of data and assistance in transition (Art. 30(2)(j)) | | |
| **Audit rights** — the unconditional right to inspect and audit the ICT third-party service provider, including the right to appoint third-party auditors (Art. 30(2)(k)) | | |
| **Incident reporting** — clear reporting by the ICT third-party service provider of ICT-related incidents (Art. 30(2)(l)) | | |

`[DORA Art. 30 — model knowledge — verify against Regulation (EU) 2022/2554 text]`

**Output format for DORA table:**

```
## DORA Art. 30 Compliance Table

Financial entity type: [from CLAUDE.md]
Vendor: [counterparty name]
ICT service: [yes/no and description]

| Clause | Status | Section in contract | Gap / action needed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Description of services | 🔴 MISSING / 🟠 INSUFFICIENT / 🟢 PRESENT | | |
[one row per Art. 30(2) requirement]

**DORA compliance summary:** [N] present, [N] insufficient, [N] missing.
[N] missing or insufficient clauses require amendment before this agreement can be signed by a DORA-regulated entity.
```

## Step 4: Purchasing-side playbook comparison

Apply `commercial.md` purchasing-side playbook. For each deviation, produce the standard finding block:

```
### [Section X.X]: [Issue name]

**Playbook says:** [position]
**Contract says:** > "[exact quote]"
**Gap:** [type]
**Legal risk:** 🔴/🟠/🟡/🟢 | **Business friction:** 🔴/🟠/🟡/🟢
**Why it matters:** [one sentence]
**Proposed redline:** "[specific replacement language]"
**If they won't move:** [fallback or "escalate to [person]"]
```

Categories to cover: SLA, liability, IP, data protection / DPA, governing law, termination, audit rights, auto-renewal.

---

## Step 5: GDPR data processing clause check

Same as `contract-review` Step 3c. If personal data processed: check for DPA / Art. 28 GDPR clause, cross-border transfer mechanism if outside EEA.

---

## Step 6: Favorable terms and gaps

**Better than our standard:** Note as trade bait.
**Missing entirely:** Common omissions — force majeure, assignment restriction, business continuity / disaster recovery (relevant for ICT), step-in rights.

---

## Step 7: Escalation routing

Check `commercial.md` escalation matrix against EUR value, 🔴 issues, and automatic escalation triggers (including: ICT third-party agreement for financial entity → always flag to legal for DORA review).

---

## Output

```
CONFIDENTIAL — INTERNAL LEGAL ANALYSIS — DRAFT FOR ATTORNEY REVIEW

# Vendor Agreement Review: [Counterparty] [Agreement Type]

**Reviewed:** [date]
**Contract value:** EUR [amount] / [term]
**Our role:** Customer / Purchasing-side
**Governing law:** [jurisdiction]
**ICT service provider:** [Yes / No]
**DORA check:** [Applicable — [N] gaps found | Not applicable]

---

## Bottom line

[Two sentences. Can we sign this? What must change first?]

**DORA gaps:** [N]🔴 [N]🟠 (if applicable)
**Playbook issues (legal risk):** [N]🔴 [N]🟠 [N]🟡 [N]🟢
**Playbook issues (business friction):** [N]🔴 [N]🟠 [N]🟡 [N]🟢
**Approval needed from:** [name or role]

## Approval routing

[escalation details]
```

**Guardrail:** Append to every output — "This analysis is a draft for attorney review and does not constitute legal advice."

---

## Redline granularity

Edit at the smallest possible granularity. Replace a word before a phrase, a phrase before a sentence, a sentence before a clause.

## Close with next-steps decision tree

> **What next?**
> 1. **Escalate** — I'll draft a note to [approver] with the DORA gaps and playbook issues
> 2. **Redline and return** — I'll produce a consolidated redline package
> 3. **Add to renewal tracker** — if auto-renewal found, I'll add it to the register
> 4. **Add vendor to ICT register** — if this is a critical ICT provider, I'll update `commercial.md`
> 5. **Route DPA for review** — hand the DPA URL or text to `/eu-legal:dpa-review`
> 6. **Something else**
