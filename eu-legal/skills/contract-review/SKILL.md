  Review a commercial agreement against your EU playbook — detects contract type,
  applies the right playbook side (sales or purchasing), checks GDPR data processing
  clause requirements, flags governing law outside the EU, and surfaces DORA Art. 30
  ICT requirements for financial entities. Use when the user says "review this
  contract", "check this MSA", "is this agreement okay", or attaches an inbound
  commercial agreement for review.

# /eu-legal:contract-review

1. Load `~/.claude/plugins/config/eu-legal/CLAUDE.md` (base profile). If missing or has `[PLACEHOLDER]`, stop: "Run `/eu-legal:cold-start-interview` first."
2. Load `~/.claude/plugins/config/eu-legal/commercial.md` (commercial playbook). If missing or has `[PLACEHOLDER]`, stop: "Run `/eu-legal:commercial-cold-start` first — I need your commercial playbook before reviewing contracts."
3. Get the agreement (file path, Drive link, or pasted text). If none provided, ask.
4. Run the workflow below.

## Purpose

Review a commercial agreement against the team's EU-law playbook. Surface every material deviation, flag GDPR and DORA obligations where applicable, and produce a prioritised issue list the reviewer can act on in one pass.

**This is a draft for attorney review and does not constitute legal advice.**

---

## Step 1: Detect contract type and side

Read document titles and the first two pages. Classify:

| Type | Description | Deep-review skill |
|---|---|---|
| NDA / Confidentiality Agreement | Confidentiality as the main agreement | `/eu-legal:nda-review` gives deeper NDA-specific review |
| MSA / Services Agreement / SOW | Master services, statement of work, consulting | This skill |
| SaaS / Subscription / Cloud Services | Recurring fee, online service, auto-renewal | This skill |
| Vendor / Procurement Agreement | Purchasing from a supplier | This skill + DORA ICT check if financial entity |
| Other | Licence, reseller, partnership | This skill |

If the contract is an NDA: run this review but note at the top of the output:
> "This is an NDA. `/eu-legal:nda-review` provides a deeper NDA-specific review using EU Trade Secrets Directive framing. Consider running it after this general review."

**Which side?** Determine whether the company is sales-side (selling its product/service) or purchasing-side (buying from a vendor). Apply the matching playbook section from `commercial.md`. If not obvious, ask.

---

## Step 2: Deal-breaker check

Check the relevant "deal-breaker" from `commercial.md` first. If present:

```
## DEAL-BREAKER PRESENT

Section [X.X] contains [the deal-breaker]. Per the playbook, this is a hard no.
Recommended next step: escalate to [approver from commercial.md] before proceeding.

Detailed review below is for completeness but is moot unless this is resolved.
```

---

## Step 3: Term-by-term review

### 3a. Playbook comparison

For each playbook category in `commercial.md` (liability, IP, data, termination, governing law), find the contract section and compare. For each deviation:

```
### [Section X.X]: [Issue name]

**Playbook says:** [position from commercial.md]

**Contract says:**
> "[exact quote]"

**Gap:** Missing term | Weaker than standard | Outside fallbacks | Unacceptable

**Legal risk:** 🔴 Blocking | 🟠 High | 🟡 Medium | 🟢 Low
**Business friction:** 🔴 Blocks deals | 🟠 Slows deals | 🟡 Confuses customers | 🟢 Invisible

**Why it matters:** [one sentence in plain language]

**Proposed redline:** "[specific replacement language]"

**If they won't move:** [fallback from commercial.md, or "escalate to [person]"]
```

### 3b. EU Trade Secrets Directive check (confidentiality clauses)

Check confidentiality / trade secrets provisions against Directive (EU) 2016/943 on the protection of undisclosed know-how and business information.

- Does the definition of confidential information align with Art. 2(1) TSD? (Information that is secret, has commercial value because it is secret, and has been subject to reasonable steps to keep it secret.)
- Are common-law trade secret formulations present ("misappropriation", "improper means" in US-law sense)? Flag these: "This clause uses US common law trade secret language. Reframe using Directive 2016/943 Art. 2 definition and Art. 4 unlawful acquisition / use / disclosure framing. `[model knowledge — verify]`"
- If governing law is Finnish: note that Liikesalaisuuslaki (Business Secrets Act 595/2018) implements Directive 2016/943. `[model knowledge — verify]`
- If governing law is German: note that GeschGehG (Geschäftsgeheimnisgesetz 2019) implements Directive 2016/943. `[model knowledge — verify]`

### 3c. GDPR data processing clause check

Ask: does this vendor / counterparty process personal data on behalf of the company?

Signals in the contract: reference to "data", "personal data", "data processing", "GDPR", "DPA", "data subjects", customer data, employee data.

**Live verification:** Call `mcp__velvoite__get_eu_regulation_article("gdpr", "28")` to verify current Art. 28 DPA requirements before flagging gaps in the contract.

**If personal data is processed:**
- Is there a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) or Art. 28 GDPR-compliant data processing clause? If no: 🔴 RED — mandatory for any processor relationship under Art. 28 GDPR. Flag: "No DPA or data processing clause found. GDPR Art. 28 requires a written contract between controller and processor. This agreement cannot proceed to signature without one."
- If a DPA is referenced by URL ("DPA available at [URL]"), note: "DPA incorporated by reference but not reviewed. Route to `/eu-legal:dpa-review` (if installed) or fetch and review before signing. `[DPA unread — verify]`"
- Check for cross-border data transfer mechanism if vendor is outside the EEA: Standard Contractual Clauses (Commission Implementing Decision 2021/914/EU, June 2021), adequacy decision, binding corporate rules. If none: 🔴 RED.

**Live verification:** Call `mcp__velvoite__search_eu_regulation_text("standard contractual clauses processor controller", "gdpr")` if module selection is unclear.

**If no personal data is processed:** Note "No DPA required — agreement does not involve personal data processing."

### 3d. DORA ICT third-party check (financial entities only)

**Gate:** Only run this step if:
- Entity type in `~/.claude/plugins/config/eu-legal/CLAUDE.md` is a financial entity (one of: `credit_institution`, `payment_institution`, `e_money_institution`, `investment_firm`, `aifm`, `ucits`, `insurance`, `reinsurance`)
- AND this is a purchasing-side agreement (company is the customer)
- AND the vendor provides ICT services (network, hardware, software, data, cloud, managed services)

If all three conditions are met:

**If `VELVOITE_API_KEY` is set:**
Call `mcp__velvoite__get_canonical_obligations` with:
- `regulation`: `dora`
- `actor_role`: `financial_entity`

From the results, surface the Art. 30 minimum contract clause requirements and check each one against the draft agreement. Flag any missing or insufficient clause as 🔴 RED.

**If `VELVOITE_API_KEY` is not set:**
Use the static DORA Art. 30 checklist:

| Art. 30 requirement | Present in contract? |
|---|---|
| Clear description of all ICT services and functions to be provided | |
| Locations where ICT services are provided and data is processed, including sub-locations | |
| Provisions on availability, authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of data | |
| Provisions ensuring access, recovery, and return of data in the event of insolvency, discontinuation, or resolution | |
| Service level descriptions and quantitative and qualitative performance targets | |
| Relevant provisions on ICT security, including minimum information security standards | |
| Sub-contracting provisions: approval of sub-contractors, obligation to inform of changes | |
| Full cooperation with authorities, including the financial entity's competent authority | |
| Termination rights, including notice periods | |
| Exit plan: assistance in transition, data portability | |
| Audit rights: financial entity's right to audit, right to appoint third-party auditors | |
| Incident reporting: ICT-related incident notification obligations | |

Flag each missing clause as 🔴 RED with note: "DORA Art. 30 — required minimum contract clause. Missing or insufficient in this draft. `[model knowledge — verify against DORA text]`"

### 3e. Governing law check

- If governing law is an EU member state: note which one; note any jurisdiction-specific issues.
- If governing law is outside the EU (UK post-Brexit, US, Singapore, etc.): 🟠 HIGH flag: "Governing law is [jurisdiction]. Your playbook prefers EU law. Non-EU governing law affects enforcement, regulatory obligations under GDPR and DORA, and jurisdiction of supervisory authorities. `[review]`"
- Compare to `commercial.md` governing law preference. Flag if not matching.

---

## Step 4: Favorable terms and gaps

**Better than our standard:** Terms where the counterparty gave more than the playbook requires. Note as trade bait.

**Missing entirely:** Standard provisions absent from the draft (common omissions: force majeure, assignment restriction, entire agreement / no reliance, notice provisions, set-off rights).

---

## Step 5: Escalation routing

Check `commercial.md` escalation matrix:
- Contract value vs. EUR thresholds
- Any 🔴 BLOCKING issues
- Any automatic escalation triggers

State clearly who needs to approve.

---

## Output

```

## Approval routing

[name, threshold, method]
```

**Guardrail:** Append to every output — "This analysis is a draft for attorney review and does not constitute legal advice."

---

## Redline granularity

Edit at the smallest possible granularity. Replace a word before a phrase, a phrase before a sentence, a sentence before a clause. Only replace a whole clause when surgical edits would be harder to read than a fresh draft — and say so when you do.

---

## Close with next-steps decision tree

> **What next?**
> 1. **Run `/eu-legal:nda-review`** — for deeper NDA-specific analysis (if this was an NDA)
> 2. **Run `/eu-legal:vendor-agreement-review`** — for deeper DORA ICT compliance table (if this is a vendor agreement)
> 3. **Escalate** — I'll draft a note to [approver] with the key issues and what decision is needed
> 4. **Get more facts** — I'd want to know [open questions]. I'll draft those as questions.
> 5. **Add to renewal tracker** — if this agreement has an auto-renewal clause, I'll add it to the register
> 6. **Something else**
