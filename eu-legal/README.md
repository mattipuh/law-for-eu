# eu-legal — EU Legal Operations for Claude Code

A Claude Code / Cowork plugin for legal teams at EU-regulated financial institutions. One setup, one profile, complete EU legal stack.

Built by [Silly Pilot Oy](https://velvoite.eu) — the team behind [Velvoite](https://velvoite.eu), the EU financial regulation compliance platform.

| **Employment** | Worker classification, termination review, works council check, leave review, international expansion |
| **Corporate** | Entity compliance (OY/GmbH/SAS/BV), board minutes, M&A diligence, closing checklist |

## Why it's different

Most legal plugins give you generic templates. eu-legal is backed by the **Velvoite EU finreg corpus** — enforcement decisions, obligation databases, and court case law (Finnish KHO, German administrative courts) across DORA, MiCA, GDPR, AI Act, MiFID II, AML, Solvency II and more.

In practice:
- `vendor-agreement-review` pulls live DORA Art. 30 ICT third-party obligations inline
- `enforcement-intelligence` shows what your entity type actually gets fined for — with case citations
- `reg-gap-analysis` scores gaps by enforcement frequency, not just article text
- `termination-review` cites Finnish TSL and German KSchG notice periods from the actual statutes

Skills work without a Velvoite account (general EU law guidance). With one they give corpus-backed answers.

## Setup

Run the cold-start interview once — takes about 10 minutes:

```
/eu-legal:cold-start-interview
```

It captures your entity type (credit institution, payment institution, CASP, etc.), primary jurisdiction (Finland, Germany, etc.), regulatory posture, and active practice areas. Everything else flows from there.

For full Velvoite corpus depth, add your API key to `.envrc`:
```bash
export VELVOITE_API_KEY=vv_your_key_here
```

## Jurisdictions

**EU-wide baseline** — all skills apply EU directive law by default.

**Deep national support:**
- 🇫🇮 **Finland** — TSL, YT-laki, Vuosilomalaki, PRH, FIN-FSA, Finnish KHO case law via Velvoite
- 🇩🇪 **Germany** — KSchG, BetrVG, BUrlG, GmbH/AG, Handelsregister, BaFin enforcement via Velvoite

Other EU member states: skills apply EU directive minimums and route to outside counsel for national specifics.

## Practice area sub-configs

Each practice area has a detailed config that unlocks deeper behaviour. Populate them after the base cold-start:

```
/eu-legal:privacy-cold-start      # DPA playbook, DSAR process, AI Act posture
/eu-legal:commercial-cold-start   # Contract playbook, DORA ICT register
/eu-legal:employment-cold-start   # Workforce footprint, FI/DE-specific settings
/eu-legal:corporate-cold-start    # Entity register, board structure
```

Skills work without these — they fall back to the base profile.

## Disclaimer

Every output from this plugin is a draft for attorney review — not legal advice, not a legal conclusion, not a substitute for a lawyer. Skills are built with guardrails that reflect that: jurisdiction assumptions surfaced, conservative defaults on legal calls, explicit gates before anything is filed or relied on. A lawyer reviews, verifies, and takes professional responsibility for anything that leaves the building.
