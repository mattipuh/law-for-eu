## GDPR startup minimum

### Do you need to comply?
Yes, if you: (a) are established in the EU, or (b) offer goods/services to EU individuals, or (c) monitor EU individuals. Finnish startups: always yes.

### Privacy notice (tietosuojaseloste)
Required by GDPR Art. 13/14 before collecting personal data. Must cover:
- [ ] Who you are (controller identity + contact)
- [ ] What data you collect
- [ ] Why (purposes) and legal basis for each purpose (Art. 6: contract / legitimate interests / consent / legal obligation)
- [ ] How long you keep it
- [ ] Who you share it with (categories of recipients, transfers outside EU)
- [ ] Data subject rights (access, erasure, correction, portability, objection)
- [ ] Right to complain to Tietosuojavaltuutettu (Finnish DPA)
- [ ] Contact for DPO (if appointed) or privacy queries

### Cookie consent
ePrivacy Directive (implemented in Finland via Sähköisen viestinnän palvelulaki) requires consent before non-essential cookies. Functional/strictly necessary cookies: no consent required. Analytics, advertising, tracking: consent required before setting.

### First processor DPA
If you use any service that processes your users' personal data on your behalf (Stripe, Mailchimp, AWS, Google Analytics, Intercom, Mixpanel, etc.) — you need a Data Processing Agreement with them. Most have standard DPAs available in their terms/settings.

### Record of Processing Activities (RoPA)
Required if: >250 employees, OR processing is not occasional, OR high-risk. Most early startups: not required, but good practice to maintain one.

### DSAR process
Have a named person or email address for data subject requests. Must respond within 1 month (extendable to 3 for complex requests).

### Breach notification
Personal data breach must be notified to Tietosuojavaltuutettu within 72 hours if likely to result in risk to individuals. Keep a breach register regardless.

GDPR compliance is ongoing, not a one-time checklist. Finnish Tietosuojavaltuutettu (TSV) can issue fines up to €20M or 4% of global turnover. This checklist covers the minimum for an early-stage startup — as you grow, engage a privacy lawyer.
