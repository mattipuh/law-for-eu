## TVL §66 vs §66a — which to use?

This decision is the most important tax choice for Finnish startup equity compensation. Always fetch current statute text before answering — the text is the ground truth.

### TVL §66 (stock options) — current law and proposed reform

**CURRENT LAW (default — apply this unless the live statute text shows otherwise):**

Under the law in force as of May 2026, options granted under TVL §66 are taxed as earned income (ansiotulo) **at exercise** — the spread between fair market value at exercise and the subscription price is taxed at progressive income tax rates (typically 30–40%+). The tax liability arises at exercise, before any exit occurs. This is the cash-flow problem for startup employees: tax is due even though the shares are illiquid.

On the eventual share sale: acquisition cost = subscription price + the amount already taxed as earned income at exercise (no double taxation).

**2026 GOVERNMENT PROPOSAL — NOT YET ENACTED AS OF MAY 2026:**

The Finnish government has proposed deferring this earned-income taxation from exercise to sale for options in qualifying unlisted companies. This would eliminate the cash-flow problem by aligning tax timing with the liquidity event.

**IMPORTANT:** As of May 2026, this is a legislative proposal only. It has NOT been enacted into law. Do not present it as current law.

**After fetching the live TVL §66 text:** read the statute carefully. If the enacted text now includes sale-timing language (e.g. "taxation occurs at the time of sale" or "myyntihetki"), the reform has been enacted — present the new rules and note the effective date. If the text still reads "taxation at exercise" (merkintähetki/hankintahetki), current law applies.

### TVL §66a (directed share issue at mathematical value)

An alternative to options: the company issues new shares to employees at the "mathematical value" (substansarvo — net assets divided by share count). If this is below market value, the difference is not income-taxed at subscription — the entire gain is treated as capital income when the shares are sold (~30% vs. up to 40%+ income tax).

Conditions (verify from fetched §66a statute): company must be unlisted; employee must work in the company; issue price must be at or above mathematical value.

Key difference from §66: shares are issued immediately (no vesting cliff possible via the scheme itself — but a separate SHA leaver mechanism can claw back shares). This makes §66a less flexible for standard cliff-and-monthly-vest ESOP structures.

**Practical comparison table (based on current law as of May 2026):**

| Factor | TVL §66 (current law) | TVL §66 (if reform enacted) | TVL §66a |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tax timing | At exercise | At sale | At sale |
| Tax type on gain | Earned income (progressive) | Earned income (progressive) | Capital gains (~30%) |
| Subscription price | At least FMV at grant | At least FMV at grant | At least mathematical value |
| Flexibility | High (strike price, cliff, vesting) | High | Lower (shares issued immediately) |
| AGM approval | Required | Required | Required |
| Cash-flow risk for employee | HIGH (tax before exit) | Low | Low |
| Good for | Standard ESOP if reform enacted | Standard startup ESOP | Early employees / low-net-asset stage |

### Recommendation logic

1. **Check if the §66 reform has been enacted** (read the live statute text fetched above).
2. If reform enacted: §66 is the standard choice for most startups. §66a advantage is reduced but still valid for capital gains rate benefit.
3. If reform NOT enacted (current law): §66 creates cash-flow risk. For early-stage companies with very low mathematical value, §66a may be more employee-friendly (capital gains rate, tax only at sale). Discuss the cash-flow risk explicitly with employees before granting §66 options.
4. If company has significant net assets (mathematical value close to market value): §66a advantage is small → use §66.

### AGM mechanics

From fetched OYL §10 text, apply current rules:
- Share options require approval from an extraordinary or annual general meeting
- Resolution must specify: total number of options, subscription price, subscription period, deviation from pre-emption rights (and reason — typically "to implement the employee option scheme")
- Board of directors then grants individual allocations based on the AGM authorisation

## Guardrail

Option scheme design has significant tax consequences for employees and the company. The TVL §66 reform was a government proposal as of May 2026 — verify current enactment status using the live statute text fetched above. This skill reads live Finlex data but does not replace advice from a Finnish tax advisor (veroasiantuntija). Before implementing any option scheme, have the scheme documents reviewed by a lawyer.
