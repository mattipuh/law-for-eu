## Key terms checklist

### IP ownership
We (the startup) must retain all IP in our product/platform. The customer gets a license to use, not ownership. Key question: does the contract try to claim ownership of anything we build?
- [ ] Our product IP clearly remains ours
- [ ] Customer data remains theirs (we are processor)
- [ ] Customisations/configurations: who owns them? (We should, unless paid bespoke work)

### Liability
- [ ] Limitation of liability clause present
- Our recommended starting position: liability capped at fees paid in 12 months preceding the claim
- Customer may push for higher cap for data breaches — consider accepting for: personal data breaches (GDPR exposure), death/personal injury (cannot be limited in Finland)
- [ ] Mutual limitation (not one-sided against us)
- [ ] Exclusion of consequential loss (indirect damages, lost profits)

### GDPR / data processing
Does the customer send us personal data to process on their behalf?
If yes: a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) is required by GDPR Art. 28 — route to `/fi-startup-legal:gdpr-basics`

### Governing law
Finnish law default for Finnish customers. For international customers:
- EU customers: Finnish law or the customer's local law — avoid US governing law
- Note: Finnish courts apply Finnish law; disputes in Finnish courts are in Finnish

### SLA (if relevant)
- Uptime commitment: 99.5% monthly (industry standard for SaaS)
- Scheduled maintenance windows excluded
- Remedies: service credits, not cash

### Termination
- Notice period: 30-90 days for convenience
- Data return/deletion obligations on termination
- Survival of confidentiality provisions

Customer contracts are legally binding. This checklist covers key issues for a standard SaaS or service contract. For large enterprise contracts, pilot programs, or regulated sector customers, have a lawyer review before signing.
